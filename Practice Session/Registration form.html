<p>In this video we have executed about the Gas Pipeline Monitoring project in the hospitals.Internal leak detection systems are the most common technologies Medical gas supply systems in hospitals and other healthcare facilities are utilized to supply specialized gases and gas mixtures to various parts of the facility. Products handled by such systems typically include Oxygen.In medical gas pipeline oxygen is used to drive anesthesia machines and Ventilators. Oxygen is denoted in the color white in a medical gas pipeline system. Role of Nitrous oxide in Medical gas pipeline system? Nitrous oxide is used via an anesthesia machine; it gets mixed with oxygen and other gases while operating.</p>
<p>Gas piping systems rely on pressure to deliver natural gas. Gas flows from higher to lower pressure. After the natural gas is extracted, it travels along a highway-like system of pipes to end up in distribution systems that bring the gas into your home.They provide a single solution for monitoring and controlling the gas supply for individual areas of the hospitals. They provide an emergency connection to supply critical areas in case of main source failure.</p>
